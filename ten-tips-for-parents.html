                <p>Children need to "interact" with language to understand its practical

                    applications in their daily lives.</p>
                <p>Art tutorials in French incite students to practice listening skills in real time. They must
                    interpret oral
                    instructions, and can infer meaning by observing the tutor 's actions.</p>
                <p>Research holds that developing aural and oral language in tandem with practicing fine motors skills,
                    such as drawing and
                    painting, helps engage different parts of the brain and facilitates language acquisition.</p>
                <p>Many art tutorials are available in French on YouTube, and DiasLearning.com has just started its own
                    art tutorials.</p>

                <p>If your child remembers the movie's characters and key elements of the plot then he/she can use this
                    previously acquired
                    knowledge as a scaffold to interpret and understand unfamiliar French audio and subtitles. Use what
                    is familiar as the
                    foundation to acquire new vocabulary and language skills.</p>
                <p>There is a wide array of French content on streaming services like Netflix, including cartoons,
                    anime, and documentaries. In addition, you can often set the audio and subtiles for DVDs to French.

                <p>Journaling is a short, effective way to help children develop and

                    communicate thoughts and opinions. The key to helping kids write is to provide potential subjects,
                    prompts, and topics
                    of inquiry.</p>
                <p>The term "Writer's block" refers to feeling unable to create new ideas. To mitigate this challenge,
                    guide students with
                    questions that incite them to develop their ideas (for example, do you think the protagonist of
                    Wonder is a good role
                    model? What challenges did he face? What would you do if you were in his place? Why might you
                    encourage a friend to
                    watch Wonder?).</p>
                <p>The journals section of the website provides examples of student- and teacher-written journals in
                    addition to potential
                    topics of discussion and guiding questions.</p>

                <p>In addition to downloading educational French apps, you can help your child develop language skills
                    with the following
                    tips:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Set the phone's default browser settings to French so that
                        queries are automatically directed to the francophone version of websites.</li>
                    <li>Make your default home page a fun French website for
                        games and lessons, such as TFO.ca/fr/enfants, RadioCanada.ca/

                        jeunesse or Allo-prof. qc.ca. This will drastically increase the likelihood your child starts to
                        use these sites on a
                        regular basis.</li>
                    <li>If your child has reached an advanced level, you can change
                        your phone's OS language setting to French. (Just make sure you know how to switch it back!)
                        This will make French the
                        default language for everything on the phone so that your child gains more French exposure
                        daily. ​</li>

                </div>

                <p>Comics and graphic novels can be useful for practicing French. Here are 5 ways they can serve as
                    learning tools:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Children are more likely to learn if they find the materials they read to be genuinely engaging
                        and interesting.</li>
                    <li>The illustrations in comics and graphic novels can serve as visual aids to infer the meaning of
                        difficult French words
                        and sentences.</li>
                    <li>Reading comics on a regular basis can help make reading a hobby and create an interest in
                        reading more complex books,
                        such as novels.</li>
                    <li>Reading comics can help practice and review commonly used vocabulary French terms,
                        colloquialisms, and expressions.</li>
                    <li>Comics are generally short quick reads, which can help children develop more confidence when
                        reading. You can also ask
                        your child to write a very brief summary or journal on the comics they've read to develop their
                        critical-thinking and
                        writing skills.</li>
                </ol>

                </div>

                <p>Listening to audiobooks can become an effective routine to practice French daily.</p>
                <p>Rather than listen to Taylor Swift's latest hit, play a French audiobook during your drive to work
                    or morning run. Audiobooks develop listening skills and can help you learn proper pronunciation and
                    new vocabulary.</p>
                <p>Many platforms offer free audiobooks, such as the Overdrive app. You can borrow popular titles such
                    as Harry Potter et la coupe de feu, and the app will automatically return the title on its due date
                    so you don't incur fines. You can change the speed of
                    the audio recording depending on your comfort level, and even set a timer or "sleep" function.</p>
                <p>For advanced students, the free Librevox app is very useful as it offers an extensive library of
                    classic literature. (Interesting fact: "Libre vox" is latin for "free voice", and Librevox is
                    working to make free audiobooks available to the general public .)</p>
                <p>Diaslearning.com is developing original French audiobooks and other French recordings tailored for a
                    younger audience. These audio recordings focus on developing the fundamentals of French.</p>

                <p>E-books enable you to highlight and save important and/or difficult passages. Many e-book apps
                    include embedded dictionaries and thesauruses, so you can instantly look up the definition of
                    unfamiliar words. A
                    second advantage of e-books is their portability compared to physical books, and you can download
                    hundreds of them for free. You can even access electronic versions of various comics, graphic
                    novels, manga, and magazines. Another advantage of e-books is that they require far less memory to
                    store than audiobooks.</p>
                <p>The aforementioned Overdrive app offers an e-book library larger than its audiobooks collection. You
                    can usually borrow titles immediately rather than be waitlisted.</p>

                <p>How can kids develop their vocabulary without having to study lists and memorize words?</p>
                <p>One simple method to build vocabulary is by completing French crosswords and word searches.</p>
                <p>The former is ideal for helping children interpret and understand the different meanings and
                    applications of French words. The latter is more geared towards learning the correct spelling and
                    morphology how a word changes depending on its context or conjugation).</p>
                <p>Children are generally engaged when completing word searches and crosswords because they tend to
                    view them as leisurely activities as opposed to tedious drills.</p>

                <p>Many Extended and French Immersion schools lead clubs in French, such as robotics clubs, yoga clubs,
                    board game clubs, and even anime clubs.</p>
                <p>There are also francophone clubs in many core French schools with a focus on promoting the many
                    diverse and multicultural states in the French-speaking world. French is not only widely-spoken in
                    France, Quebec, and Belgium, but also in nations such as Haiti, Mauritius, and the Ivory Coast.</p>
                <p>Multiculturalism and equity clubs can simultaneously promote diversity and the French language by
                    teaching facts about francophone cultures and people.</p>
                <p>Local teachers can potentially establish monthly correspondence with teachers from francophone
                    communities, such as those in Sudbury, Winnipeg, New Orleans, or Lyon (just to name a few).</p>
                <p>This provides the opportunity for classes and clubs to pair up with "language learning buddies". They
                    can discover the experiences of other students in a different city, province, country, or continent.

                <p>In addition to identifying effective strategies to help learn French, we must plan how to implement
                    them.</p>
                <p>When the best strategies are not consistently implemented, their results are diminished. Think of it
                    this way: if you had a routine with the very best physical exercises, but did not workout on a
                    regular basis, you would not obtain
                    optimal results.</p>
                <p>At the start of each week, write a very simple short plan for learning French.</p>
                <p>Change things up every few weeks so your learning plan does not become redundant. Feel free to take a
                    day off each week. The weekly plan should also be modified based on your child's age, level, and
                    particular needs. </p>
